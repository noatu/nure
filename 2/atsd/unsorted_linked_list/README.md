# Unsorted Linked List

implements a basic Singly Linked List that supports appending elements to the end and printing the contents. It features a Bubble Sort algorithm that sorts the list by swapping the integer values stored in the nodes, rather than rewiring the next pointers.

Execution result:
```
List:   [42, 1, 37, 69, 9, 96, 12, 36]
Sorted: [1, 9, 12, 36, 37, 42, 69, 96]
Add 36: [1, 9, 12, 36, 37, 42, 69, 96, 36]
Sorted: [1, 9, 12, 36, 36, 37, 42, 69, 96]
```
